Every weekend I build a machine learning project to get my hands dirty in data science, this week I picked MNIST Dataset.

“You can have anything you want in life if you dress for it.” — Edith Head.
so, buckle up for some code, memes and a little bit of theory.

# STEP 1: PROBLEM STATEMENT AND BUSINESS CASE
The fashion training set consists of 70,000 images divided into 60,000 training and 10,000 testing samples. Dataset sample consists of 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

The 10 classes are as follows: </br>
0 => T-shirt/top </br>1 => Trouser </br>2 => Pullover </br>3 => Dress </br>4 => Coat </br>5 => Sandal </br>6 => Shirt </br>7 => Sneaker </br>8 => Bag </br>9 => Ankle boot

Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255.

# STEP 3: VISUALIZATION OF THE DATASET

# STEP 2: IMPORTING DATA

# STEP 4: TRAINING THE MODEL

# STEP 5: EVALUATING THE MODEL
